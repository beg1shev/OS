One of the possibilities to make the result in increased Hit/Miss ratio is sequence of repeating numbers. Ex: 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... That is because there will be no misses(any miss then will be reused and lead to result of hit).

In the other hand, sequence of unique numbers will result in decreased Hit/Miss ratio, due to the getting miss every time. Ex: 1 2 3 4 ...
